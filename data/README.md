- **Source:** American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year PUMS (via `tidycensus`).  
- **Scope:** Connecticut respondents only.  
- **Processing:**  
  - Variables renamed and cleaned in `R/01_download_ct_acs.R`.  
  - Incomes adjusted using `ADJINC`.  
  - Negative values replaced with `"b"` (NA marker).  
  - Limited to individuals with positive incomes.

These curated files are included for reproducibility â€” they are much smaller than raw ACS extracts.
